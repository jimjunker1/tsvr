# Preparing the data
\noindent A typical dataset for analysis using `tsvr` is an $N \times T$ matrix of numeric 
values where rows correspond to species in a community (so the number of species is $N$)
and columns correspond to evenly spaced times during which sampling was conducted (so the
number of times sampling was conducted is $T$). Matrix entries may be densities, or percent
cover values, or other measures of abundance in a community.

Standard implementations of Fourier trasforms require time series consisting
of measurements taken at evenly spaced times, with no missing data. The core functions provided
in `tsvr` make these same assumptions and throw an error if data are missing.
<!--***DAN: make sure they actually do throw an error-->
The user is left to decide on and implement a reasonable way of filling missing
data, if there such a way. We have previously 
used the simple approach of
replacing missing values in a time series by the median of the non-missing values in the
time series [@Sheppard_16]. This approach, and other related simple 
procedures [@Sheppard_16], seem
unlikely to artefactually produce significant synchrony, or 
coherence relationships with other
variables, but rely on the percentage of missing data being fairly low and may obscure 
detection of synchrony or significant coherence relationships if too many data are 
missing. For applications which differ meaningfully from the prior work for which
the tools of this package were developed,
<!--***DAN: cite Lei's tsvr here-->
different ways of dealing with missing data may be more appropriate.

The timescale-specific variance ratio techniques which are the focus of this package
us Fourier methods to decompose by timescale the classic 
variance ratio and related quantities. Detrending and
variance standardization across time series, data preparation techniques which are often
applied before doing Fourier analysis, may not be approriate unless it makes sense 
to calculate the classic variance ratio, and related quantities, after performing those
data preparation techniques. And usually that is not what has been done.
